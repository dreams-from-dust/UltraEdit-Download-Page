# UltraEdit Download Page Clone

A responsive replica of the UltraEdit software download page, built for learning purposes. This project was developed from scratch using HTML and CSS to showcase foundational front-end skills in modern web layout design.

### Key Features

* **Responsive Layout:** The design adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes. Flexbox is used for the navigation and the main download section, while a CSS Grid layout is used for the language download cards.
* **Modern CSS Techniques:** The page utilizes Flexbox (`display: flex`) with `flex-wrap` to ensure elements wrap correctly on smaller screens. Media queries are also implemented to optimize the layout for different devices.
* **Semantic HTML:** The page is structured with HTML5 semantic elements like `<header>` and `<main>` for improved accessibility and organization.
* **Interactive Elements:** CSS `:hover` effects are used to provide user feedback on navigation links and download buttons.
